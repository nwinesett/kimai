#This is a cpanel.yml file for the hosted websites of Nathan Winesett
#using a shared cpanel hosting package through Westhost.com.  This file
#allows me to push my Github commits to the repository saved using
#cPanel's Git Version Control and automatically deploy the changes
#to the website.  When I have multiple installations, I can use
#one repository to deploy to multiple websites using multiple DEPLOYPATHs
